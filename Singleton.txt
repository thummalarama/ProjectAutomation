What is Singleton architecture?

Singleton is a class that can have only one object(instance of a class) which can be used by all other classes. 

  1. Make constructor as private. It prevent to instantiate the singleton class from outside the class.
  2. Write a static method that has return type of object of this Singleton Class(Lazy initialization). 
Difference between normal class and Singleton Class is for normal class we use constructor whereas for Singleton class we use getInstance() method for instantiation.
