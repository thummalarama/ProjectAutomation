Page Object Model(POM) is an Object design pattern,popularly used in test automation that creates Object Repository for web elements.
The advantage of the POM is that it reduces code duplication, easy readability and improves test maintenance.
In POm, we use page object repository and Page factory. 
In page object, it organize page objects as per pages in such a way that scripts and page objects can be differentiated easily. 
It defines locators using "By". We need to initialise every page object individually.
Page Factory is another way to implement Page object model which is inbuilt in Selenium.
It defines locators by using @FindBy annotation. 
Page factory is a class which provides implementation of POM design approach. All Page objects are initialized by using initElements method.
